# Basic Responsive Design Principles
1. **Fluid grids and layouts**
To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse the website. Uses `%` rather than `px` for all layout-related lengths. 

2. **Flexible/Responsive Images**
Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport.

3. **Media Queries**
To change styles on a certain viewport widths (breakpoints), allowing us to create different versions of our website for different widths.

## Layout Types
1. Float layouts
2. Flexbox
3. CSS Grid

For this project we’re going to be using a Float based layout where we simply put boxes side by side using floats, simple as that. It’s a method that is still being used today. This is because all the modern layout alternatives are not 100% supported by all other browsers. 

Our modern alternatives are Flexbox and CSS Grid. Flexbox offers an amazing way of laying out elements in a one dimensional row and CSS grid is a perfect way of creating an overall of a page in a fully fledged two dimensional grid. 

The thing is, the layout is the single most fundamental aspect of our design and so if a browser does not support a technology like Flexbox or CSS Grid then that can pose as a problem.

We will, however, be working on these technologies in future projects.
