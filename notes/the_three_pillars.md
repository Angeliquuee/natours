# The Three Pillars to HTML and CSS
1. Responsive design
2. Maintainable and scalable code
3. Web performance

### Responsive design
What is responsive design? To architect a responsive design we would need it to work in a way where it will operate beautifully across all screen sizes on all devices.

It’s definitely a standard as of today. Here are some of the fundamentals in responsive design

* Fluid layouts
* Media queries
* Responsive images
* Correct units
* Desktop-first vs. mobile-first

### Maintainable and scalable code
Writing maintainable code is something all professional web developers care about a lot.

* Clean
* Easy-to-understand
* Growth
* Reusable
* How to organize files
* How to name classes
* How to structure HTML

### Web performance
Making a website or app more performant means to make It faster and make it smaller in size, so that the user has to download less data. Now, there are many things that affect performance, and some factors don’t have much to do with our code. But some of the things that we can do is to make as little HTTP requests as possible, meaning that we should include as little as possible files in our HTML document, write as little code as possible of course, compress our code, and use a preprocessor like SASS.

The biggest impact on our websites that we can is actually reducing the use of images because images are usually what makes up by far the biggest size of a website. We can do so by using only images there are really necessary for a website or app. And also by compressing these images, so that you may use less bandwidth for the final user. To sum it up in a short list:

* Less HTTP requests
* Less code
* Compress code
* Use a CSS preprocessor
* Less images
* Compress images
