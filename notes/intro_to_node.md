# A Brief Introduction to NPM and the Node Ecosystem
Node.JS allows developers to write and run JavaScript applications on the server. Developers started using node.js to also write tools to help them with **local web development**

NPM is a simple command line interface that allows developers to **install and manage packages** on their local computers. There are all kinds of open-source **tools**, **libraries and frameworks** needed for modern development. Modern web development could simply not exist without a package manger.

Today, every serious front-end developer uses some kind of package manager like NPM.
