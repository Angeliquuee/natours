# The Visual Formatting Model
The CSS **visual formatting model** is an algorithm that calculates boxes and determines the layout of theses boxes, for each element in the render tree, in order to determine the final layout of the page.

In order to do this, the algorithm takes into account factors like:

* **Dimensions of boxes**: the box model
* **Box type**: inline, block and in-line block
* **Positioning scheme**: floats and positioning
* **Stacking contexts**
* Other elements in the render tree
* Viewport size, dimensions of images, etc

By putting all of these factors together the browser will figure out how the website will look for the user.
